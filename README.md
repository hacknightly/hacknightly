## Me In a Nutshell


<a id="org1497e3c"></a>

- 🚶🏿 Just a laid back guy with a passion for building meaningful software and personal productivity! I'm probably in the middle of a Pomodoro right now lol.


<a id="org2df8652"></a>

## My Style


<a id="org818fe10"></a>

- 🚧 I live and die by the roadmap - I don't mind agility & flexibility, but having a well-defined mission with clear goals is my preference


<a id="orgf424db3"></a>

- 🧠 I enjoy learning new things all the time - I hang out in Coursera - let's dive into some uncharted territory together!


<a id="org3cdf548"></a>

- 👐 I like to dive into deep work, but am also always open to pairing & collaboration!


<a id="orgc95ea4e"></a>

## My Values


<a id="org80b99fd"></a>

- Transparency - I like to be 100% honest about life, work, and my feelings. WYSIWYG!

<a id="org752fc01"></a>

<a id="org84b3a29"></a>

- Come prepared! Having an agenda will help us both know what we expect from our collaboration.


<a id="org9576b6b"></a>

<a id="org85cb5cb"></a>

<a id="org0ff57f6"></a>

## What People Misunderstand About Me


<a id="org1a9314b"></a>

- I tend to have an overabundence of positivity, but that doesn't mean I'm not taking your feelings or situation seriously - I just like to smile!


<a id="org4b14dd4"></a>

## What I want to Improve on as a human being


<a id="orgb6832cb"></a>

- Listening. Sometimes I talk too much.
- Empathy. A decade of working in an industry with so much privilege can leave one feeling disconnected from the real problems in the world.

## Thank You
